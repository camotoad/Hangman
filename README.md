# Hangman game

the goal is to make a hangman game that retrieves words from an external source

update 01/05/2021: Will now use BeautifulSoup to retrieve a word from http://randomword.com.
    If internet cannot be connected to, a word from words.txt (words from https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000) would be selected instead.

to play, run game.py
